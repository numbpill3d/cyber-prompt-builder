## Environment Variables Required

### Required for Production
```bash
# Application
NODE_ENV=production
REACT_APP_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production

# At least one AI provider API key
REACT_APP_PROVIDERS_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OR
REACT_APP_PROVIDERS_CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OR
REACT_APP_PROVIDERS_GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# Default provider
REACT_APP_PROVIDERS_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openai
```

### Optional Configuration
```bash
# Agent Settings
REACT_APP_AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=3
REACT_APP_AGENT_ENABLE_TASK_BREAKDOWN=true
REACT_APP_AGENT_ENABLE_ITERATION=true
REACT_APP_AGENT_ENABLE_CONTEXT_MEMORY=true

# Prompt Builder Settings
REACT_APP_PROMPT_BUILDER_MAX_TOKENS=4096
REACT_APP_PROMPT_BUILDER_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# TTS Settings
REACT_APP_TTS_ENABLED=false
REACT_APP_TTS_VOICE=en-US-Standard-A

# Debug Settings (should be false in production)
REACT_APP_APP_DEBUG=false
REACT_APP_LOGGING_LEVEL=info
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Failures
- Check TypeScript errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### Runtime Errors
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient quota
- Check network connectivity to AI providers

### Performance Issues
- Analyze bundle size with `npm run build:analyze`
- Check for memory leaks
- Optimize images and assets
- Enable compression

### Security Issues
- Verify CSP headers are not blocking resources
- Check for mixed content warnings (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Validate input sanitization is working

## Deployment Commands

### Build for Production
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run build:check
```

### Test Production Build Locally
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deploy to Render
```bash
git push origin main
# Render will automatically build and deploy
```

## Monitoring URLs

### Health Check
- Production: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
- Local: `http://localhost:3000/health`

### API Configuration
- Production: `https://your-app.onrender.com/api/config`
- Local: `http://localhost:3000/api/config`

## Support Contacts

- **Technical Issues**: Check GitHub Issues
- **Security Issues**: Report privately via email
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor application metrics

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected after deployment:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous working version
2. **Investigation**: Check logs and error reports
3. **Fix**: Address the root cause
4. **Re-deploy**: Test thoroughly before re-deployment

## Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] All critical user flows work
- [ ] Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities are detected
- [ ] Error rates are below threshold (< 1%)
- [ ] Response times are acceptable (< 2s for page loads)
